                                A member of our team will process your application. If you provided copies of your ID and scheme documentation we will
                                use these to verify your identity. Once we have completed our checks we will delete your documents and get back to you
                                via email. If you are an existing Big Group member and provided your Big Group username, we will contact you via the Big

                            <p>
                                In order to become a full LCAG member, we ask for a small contribution towards our fighting fund.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The majority of the work we do is free of charge, the website and forum and other materials are
                                supplied and supported by members in their spare time. However some of our activities do require funding. For
                                example, PR, consultancy and advertising.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From now on, LCAG emails, access to the forum and advice on dealing with your MP can only be provided to full LCAG members (that is, those who have paid either the annual or monthly subscription).
                                <br/>
                                Membership is available to all, in two bands, depending on income as follows:
                                <br/>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Rate 1 - Individuals with incomes over &#163;35,000 a year - &#163;10 a month or &#163;105 a year</li>
                                    <li>Rate 2 - Individuals with incomes under &#163;35,000 a year - &#163;5 a month or &#163;55 a year</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br/>
                                We are very keen for LCAG to represent all those facing HMRC action for use of loan or similar schemes and also very keen to allow those on lower incomes to be able to join, including public sector workers. This is why we are offering Rate 2.
